# Breaking Bad Quotes
## With Clojurescript + Reagent

[LIVE DEMO](https://breaking-bad-quotes.firebaseapp.com/)

A simple web app that spits out quotes from the TV-series "Breaking Bad".  
It uses [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/) (React Wrapper for Clojurescript), [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org/) and the [Breaking Bad Quotes API](https://github.com/shevabam/breaking-bad-quotes) under the hood and has minimal styling with [Wing CSS](https://kbrsh.github.io/wing/) and [Foundation Icons](https://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3).

It is inspired by the [FreeCodeCamp Project: Build a Random Quote Machine](https://freecodecamp.org).

### Requirements

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/).

- Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

- Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

- User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
