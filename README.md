# Breaking Bad Quotes

> With Clojurescript + Reagent

A simple web app that displays random quotes from the TV-series "Breaking Bad". You can ask for new quotes or tweet the current quote.

You can see the live demo **[here](https://breaking-bad-quotes.firebaseapp.com/)**.

## Motivation

I made this project so I could learn how to create a front-end app in Clojurescript and Reagent as an alternative to Javascript and React.

It is inspired by the [FreeCodeCamp Project: Build a Random Quote Machine](https://freecodecamp.org):

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/).

- Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

- Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

- User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
